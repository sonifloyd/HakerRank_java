We need to count the number of valleys during the hike:

A valley starts when you go below sea level (altitude < 0) and ends when you return to sea level.



public static int countingValleys(int steps, String path) {
    int seaLevel = 0;
    int altitude = 0;
    int valleys = 0;
    
    for (char step : path.toCharArray()) {
        if (step == 'U') {
            altitude++;
            if (altitude == 0) {
                valleys++; // came up to sea level, so a valley is completed
            }
        } else if (step == 'D') {
            altitude--;
        }
    }
    
    return valleys;
}

✅ Time Complexity
O(n) where n is the number of steps — iterate once through the string.

✅ Space Complexity
O(1) — only a few integer variables are used
